"the present cross-over study clearly showed that the same amount of ampicillin, whether S_T_U_D_Y iv or orally, resulted in plasma levels that were significantly V_E_R_B in P_G than in nonP_G women.",1
"the plasma levels during P_G were V_E_R_B than could be expected merely because of the V_E_R_B in mean body weight, which amounted to <5.9%.",1
"the value for P_K of ampicillin was V_E_R_B during P_G than after, and the difference remained when the dose was calculated per kg of body weight.",1
that the V_E_R_B in plasma levels was not a simple parallel to the V_E_R_B in body weight during P_G was further suggested by the finding that there was no S_T_U_D_Y between the difference in P_K and the difference in weight for each individual during and after P_G.,1
"there was also no S_T_U_D_Y between the length of P_G (nine to 36 weeks) and the V_E_R_B in peak levels in plasma, or P_K.",1
the difference in plasma levels was most likely due to V_E_R_B volumes of plasma and body water during P_G [3].,1
V_E_R_B volumes of plasma and total body water will be reflected in a V_E_R_B P_K for ampicillin in P_G women as compared with that in nonP_G women.,1
the difference in P_K may also reflect cha during P_G in the S_T_U_D_Y of ampici to plasma proteins and peripheral tissues.,1
"this action, however, would not substantially V_E_R_B P_G plasma levels of ampicillin, since the uterus with its contents at the stage of P_G of most women in this study (midP_G) accounts for only 180/% of the V_E_R_B in body weight [12].",1
"the amounts of ampicillin recovered in urine were similar during and after P_G, but the plasma levels during P_G were lower; therefore the c1, value in P_G became V_E_R_B.",1
"since c1, varies indirectly with tl/2, the value for c1p will V_E_R_B as the value for t/2 decreases.",1
the lack of a significant difference in P_K of the oral dose during and after P_G agrees well with the similar amounts of ampicillin recovered in urine and makes it unlikely that the P_K of orally S_T_U_D_Y ampicillin is V_E_R_B during P_G.,1

after oral administration of pivmecillinam the recovery of unchanged mecillinam in 8 h in the urine was 28% during P_G and 39% in non-P_G state.,1
"in the parturient group b (n = 10) the mean P_G vein mecillinam concentration at the time of birth 1 h after the injection of the drug was 2.9 Ã”Ã¸Î© 0.9 ,ug ml-' and the mean P_G arterial concentration was 2.7 Ã”Ã¸Î© 0.9 jig ml-'.",1
the ratio of P_G to mecillinam concentration in the P_G plasma one hour after drug injection was 0.85.,1
"the mean P_G drug concentration was 0.7 Ã”Ã¸Î© 0.3 ,ug ml-' at 1 h after parenteral administration of mecillinam in the parturient group, 0.45 Ã”Ã¸Î© 0.6 jig ml-' in early P_G and 0.06 Ã”Ã¸Î© 0.06 ml-' after oral dosage during P_G.",1
"the ratios of P_G drug concentration to simultaneous P_G plasma drug concentration were 0.21, 0.18 and 0.04 for the three groups, respectively.",1
"our results indicate that the pharmacokinetics of mecillinam V_E_R_B during P_G, but these V_E_R_Bs are apparently not of clinical importance.",1
"the P_G plasma volume expands at 30-34 weeks of P_G by nearly 50% (parker, 1984), which probably affects the volume of distribution of polar drugs (reynolds & knott, 1989).",1
"the weight corrected P_K was significantly faster during early than late P_G, which may also reflect the pooling of blood in the feto-P_G unit.",1
"hence, any V_E_R_B in serum protein-S_T_U_D_Y during P_G (reynolds & knott, 1989) should not influence the pharmacokinetics of mecillinam.",1
"mean peak plasma drug P_K were V_E_R_B during early and late P_G as compared to the nonpregnant state, and this was more pronounced in early P_G.",1
the P_K of parenteral mecillinam is longer during P_G as compared to the non-P_G state (S_T_U_D_Y 2).,1
this is probably caused by the expansion of the volume of distribution combined with an unchanged P_K.,1
the somewhat V_E_R_B rate ofurinary excretion of mecillinam during P_G is explained by the V_E_R_B drug P_K in the blood.,1
"mecillinam V_E_R_B the placenta readily, since the ratio of P_G to P_G plasma concentration is V_E_R_B, and the concentration in P_G plasma exceeds the micvalues (1-6 jig ml-') for susceptible organisms (neu, 1977).",1
"on the other hand, diffusion through the amniotic membranes and excretion of the drug by the foetus mecillinam and pivmecillinam in P_G 633 seems to be minimal.",1
these results suggest that no V_E_R_B in the dosage of mecillinam/pivmecillinam is necessary during P_G in spite of some V_E_R_B in pharmacokinetics.,1
"hobbins, m.d.* abstract the pharmacokinetics of theophylline was determined in six P_G, nonsmoking women in P_G at term following a single bolus infusion of 5.6 mg/kg of aminophylline over 20 minutes.",1
"compared to values reported in the literature for nonpregnant adult nonsmokers, the volume distribution (mean 573 Ã”Ã¸Î© 53 ml/kg) and P_K rate (mean .88 Ã”Ã¸Î© .24 ml/kg/min) of theophylline is V_E_R_B in P_G, but the P_K (mean 7.95 Ã”Ã¸Î© 2 hrs) remains unaltered.",1
"similar doses of aminophylline can therefore be used in P_G and nonP_G adults who do not smoke cigarettes, but the infusion rate required to maintain a mean serum concentration of 10jug/ml (0.5 mg/kg/hr) is almost half that initially reported in the literature.",1
"the serum theophylline P_K in P_G venous and mixed P_G at delivery were almost identical, which implies that theophylline V_E_R_B the placenta rapidly and that the fetus represents a ""shallow"" drug compartment.",1
"the same dose regimen for intravenous aminophylline has been advocated for P_G patients,1 although the pharmacokinetics of aminophylline following intravenous bolus infusion has not been determined in P_G women.",1
"to our knowledge, the pharmacokinetics of aminophylline has only been addressed by a single study10 which reported the P_K rate, volume of distribution, and P_K of aminophylline in three asthmatic P_G women following oral administration, but failed to report the smoking status of the patients.",1
"the purpose of this paper is to report on the pharmacokinetics of aminophylline in P_G women in P_G at term, who do not smoke cigarettes, and on the P_G of the drug.",1
patients were given a single intravenous dose of 5.6 mg/kg of aminophylline over a 20-minute period.,1
pharmacokinetics of theophylline in P_G patients/romero et al method described by wagner13 produces the lowest peak values and was therefore employed in this study.,1
results the P_K obtained from theophylline in this study are shown in S_T_U_D_Y 1.,1
"the mean beta-disposition constant, /?, and P_K, tte, were 0.092 Ã”Ã¸Î© .023 ( h r 1 ) and 7.95 Ã”Ã¸Î© 2 (hrs), respectively.",1
the mean P_K rate was .88 Ã”Ã¸Î© .24 ml/k/min and the mean volume of distribution was 573 Ã”Ã¸Î© 53 ml/kg.,1
the theophylline concentration reached a mean peak level of 10.7 Ã”Ã¸Î© .82 jug/ml after a loading dose of 5.6 mg/kg delivered over 20 minutes.,1
"the mean serum aminophylline concentration-time curve is shown in S_T_U_D_Y 1, together with the standard deviation.",1
"an inverse S_T_U_D_Y existed between the P_K and P_K rate of aminophylline in individual patients (fig. 2), but there was no S_T_U_D_Y between either the P_K or the P_K rate of aminophylline and its P_K.",1

"the P_K rate is V_E_R_B, but the serum P_K remains essentially unaltered (S_T_U_D_Y 3).",1
"the expansion of the extracellular fluid and blood volumes that accompanies P_G, and the presence of the fetal compartment, probably account for the V_E_R_B volume distribution.",1

the magnitude of this effect is such that quantitatively significant changes in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of certain drugs may be expected to occur during P_G (in addition to possible changes caused by other P_G-related effects such as V_E_R_B activity of drug-metabolizing enzyme systems).,1
"while average steady-state free drug P_K may not be V_E_R_B by changes in serum S_T_U_D_Y, the concentration-time profile of free drug during a dosing interval (in the case of intermittent dosing rather than continuous dosing by infusion or controlled-release dosage forms) can be modified substantially; maximum P_K may be V_E_R_B and clin.",1
attempts to determine the effect ofpregnancy on in vivo pharmacokinetics must take into consideration the possibility of concurrent changes in the activity of drug-metabolizing enzyme systems and in the serum S_T_U_D_Y of drugs.,1
reduction of both enzyme activity and S_T_U_D_Y may result in little or no net V_E_R_B of total drug P_K and therefore of steadystate total drug serum concentration produced by a dosage regimen.,1
"this is so because V_E_R_B enzyme activity will V_E_R_B the intrinsic P_K and because the total P_K of many drugs is the product of intrinsic P_K and serum free fraction (which is V_E_R_B when S_T_U_D_Y is V_E_R_B)."" the distribution of drugs between mother and fetus, and therefore the plasma concentration of total drug in newborn infants of mothers who took these drugs during P_G, is affected by S_T_U_D_Y in P_G and fetal plasma.",1

"by 72 h the blood level was below 5 ng. ml- 1. 482 discussion betaxolol is a selective [3-adrenoceptor blocking agent with V_E_R_B bioavailibility ( -~80% ), limited plasma S_T_U_D_Y ( ~ 50%) and elevated liposolubility (morselli et al., 1983; beresford and heel, 1986).",1
the blood P_K P_K in adult hypertensive patients ranges from 16 to 20 h (bianchetti et al. 1986).,1
the results now obtained in P_G women and newborns are consistent with its physicochemical properties and its pharmacokinetic profile in hypertensive S_T_U_D_Y.,1
the apparent blood P_K halflife (15-22 h) was also within the range observed in adult patients undergoing chronic treatment with the drug.,1
on this basis it appears that the pharmacokinetic profile of betaxolol is not modified in P_G women in the P_G.,1
betaxolol P_K in P_G P_G were 2-3 fold V_E_R_B than those in blood up to 24-48 h after dosing.,1
"comparison with data for other [3-blockers indicates a V_E_R_B P_G/blood ratios (2.5-10) for acebutolol and a similar value (1.6-4.5) for atenolol, metoprolol, oxprenoloi and propranolol (boutroy et al. 1986; kulas et al. 1984; liedholm et al. 1981; lundborg et al. 1981; sandstrom and regardh 1980; sioufi et al. 1984; thorley et al. 1983; white et al. 1984).",1
"considering the drug P_K in the neonates, the apparent blood P_K ranged from 14.9 to 38.5 h, with an trend towards a negative S_T_U_D_Y with the P_G S_T_U_D_Y.",1
"it is interesting that in newborns of less than 36 weeks, the apparent P_K was about 32% V_E_R_B (p < 0.01) than in the full-term neonates.",1
"a similar, V_E_R_B blood P_K in newborns has been described for other [3-blockers (bianchetti et al. 1981; boutroy et al. 1982; rnbin et al. 1983; lindeberg et al. 1987).",1
a negative S_T_U_D_Y between plasma or blood P_K and P_G S_T_U_D_Y has been described for many other drugs which depend for their P_K on metabolic degradation or renal excretion (morselli et al. 1980).,1
the renal P_K of betaxolol in the neonate during thr first 72h of life was very V_E_R_B indeed (0.95- 3.53ml.min-1).,1
"V_E_R_B renal P_K has only a very limited impact on the total P_K of the compound, since betaxolol is mostly cleared by metabolic degradation.",1
in a certain number of cases an V_E_R_B in the blood P_K was observed after 48-60 h of life.,1
"such a phenomenon could be due to maturation of the physiological mechanisms important in drug excretion or to a V_E_R_B or disappearance of the possible pharmacodynamic effects of the drug on the heart, liver and kidney.",1
"in conclusion, data on the pharmacokinetics of betaxolol in the P_G indicate that in the mothers the pharmacokinetic profile is similar to that observed in non P_G adult hypertensive patients.",1
the P_K in the neonate is moderately prolonged and there is a certain negative S_T_U_D_Y with the P_G S_T_U_D_Y.,1

the results concerning propranolol P_K during P_G are contradictory.,1
in our previous investigations [glockner et al. 1983] we found a tendency of V_E_R_B P_K P_K of propranolol in P_G hypertensive patients.,1
smith et a1.[1983] indicated in their study that the pharmacokinetics of propranolol and some of its metabolites are not changed by P_G.,1
"however, the P_K of naphthoxylacetic acid, a metabolite formed by ndealkylation of propranolol and further oxidation, was competitively inhibited by increasing levels of progresterone and estradiol as P_G progressed.",1
in these patients P_K and distribution parameters P_G were not different as compared to P_G.,1
"hoegstedt et al. [1983] found an V_E_R_B P_K of metoprolol in P_G, for which an V_E_R_B hepatic metabolism seemed to be the explanation because P_G has minor influence on P_K.",1

"in their experiments phenobarbital influenced plasma S_T_U_D_Y, P_K, metabolism, and thus pharmacokinetics of propranolol.",1
our investigations confirm this point of view as neither peak P_K nor ave values of propranolol in the P_G patients pretreated with phenobarbital were significantly different from those in untreated P_G patients.,1
further knowledge concerning the influence of P_G and of enzyme inducers on propranolol metabolism in man will be obtained by measuring in the individual patient several times not only propranolol P_K but all its metabolic pathways.,1

the drug was also eliminated more slowly from P_G than plasma.,1
"in contrast, caffeine and phenacetin P_K in P_G and plasma were similar, but P_G levels were somewhat V_E_R_B than plasma levels in both S_T_U_D_Y.",1

in both S_T_U_D_Y codeine P_K in P_G were 1.5 to 2.4 times as V_E_R_B as in plasma at the same times after drug.,1
metabolically produced morphine levels in P_G from both mothers were V_E_R_B but exceeded those in plasma after 1 hr.,1

in each case caffeine was V_E_R_B in the P_G in the greatest amount.,1
concentration-time curves for analgesic drugs in P_G and plasma of S_T_U_D_Y 1.,1
the plasma and P_G concentration-time profiles for these drugs in this S_T_U_D_Y are shown in fig. 1.,1
"a smaller number of comparative plasma samples were obtained from S_T_U_D_Y 2, as shown in fig. 2, which presents concentration-time curves in P_G and plasma.",1

"as shown in S_T_U_D_Y i, the drug P_K in P_G from S_T_U_D_Y 1 (4.7 hr) was much longer than the plasma P_K (3.0 hr).",1
the relatively hydrophilic and weakly acidic nature of acetaminophen probably contributed to the longer time required to cross lipid membranes of the mammary gland to reach maximum P_K in P_G and to the relatively slower P_K of the drug from the P_G.,1
caffeine remained the only species still clearly detectable (200 ng/ml) in P_G from S_T_U_D_Y 2 at 48 hr after drug.,1
"this persistance is reflected in the approximately 16-hr apparent P_K of caffeine in this S_T_U_D_Y, which is considerably longer than the average caffeine P_K of 6 hr reported for man.22 the salicylic acid concentrationtime profiles (figs. 1 and 2) illustrate the relative P_G: plasma distribution of a polar, acidic drug.",1
"salicylic acid penetrated lipid membranes into P_G very poorly and, once in the P_G, was eliminated very slowly.",1
it is of interest that salicylate also penetrates poorly into saliva since the saliva: plasma ratio in man has been reported to be 0.03.14 plasma and P_G disposition curves for codeine were parallel and the P_G had a similar and V_E_R_B concentration of codeine at 1 hr (ratio 2.31) and 12 hr (ratio 2.20) after drug.,1
the P_G : P_K ratio for this S_T_U_D_Y was 2.46.,1
"although both codeine and morphine P_K values for P_G in this S_T_U_D_Y were V_E_R_B than the corresponding values for plasma, the morphine : codeine P_K ratio in P_G (0.13) was of the same order as for plasma (0.11).",1
"P_G: plasma concentration ratios (S_T_U_D_Y ii) for morphine in S_T_U_D_Y 2(1.07 at 1 hr, 4.14 at 12 hr) emphasized the slower P_K of this metabolite from P_G than from plasma, in agreement with the auc42 P_G: plasma ratio calculated for S_T_U_D_Y 1.",1
the interesting behavior of morphine formed metabolically from codeine in entering the P_G and maintaining a steady concentration over approximately 10 hr could not be compared with published data obtained following direct administration of morphine because we could not find such concentration-time data in the scientific literature.,1
"in our study, the availability of concentration-time data, particularly in the cases of codeine, morphine, phenacetin, and caffeine, was made possible by the accessibility of highly sensitive ria and quantitative tlc analytical methods.",1
S_T_U_D_Y i presents the estimated average P_G P_K for S_T_U_D_Y 1 during the 12 hr after drug and amounts of drugs and metabolites that would be V_E_R_B in the P_G of this S_T_U_D_Y over this period if 500 ml P_G were secreted during the 12 hr.,1
"this represents a generous estimate of P_G secretion compared with those cited in a recent review .29 from S_T_U_D_Y i, it is clear that this approximation results in very V_E_R_B percentages of drug being V_E_R_B in the mother's P_G.",1
"in our study the highest estimated level of excretion was for caffeine (0.7% of dose), while all other estimated drug amounts in 12-hr P_G secretions were less than 0.2% of the dose.",1
"in the case of S_T_U_D_Y 2, all drugs but caffeine had fallen to nondetectable levels in P_G by 48 hr, enabling calculations of estimated steady-state P_G P_K to be made by use of the P_K,t values.",1
"clearly the calculated percentages of each drug appearing in the P_G of S_T_U_D_Y 2 over this 48-hr period are very V_E_R_B, with the proportion being highest for caffeine (2.3% ofdose).",1
study design: daily subcutaneous injections of enoxaparin sodium (40 mg) were S_T_U_D_Y to 13 P_G women.,1
results: the P_K and the P_G in P_G compared with the P_G state were not significantly different.,1
"during early and late P_G, maximum concentration and the last measurable antiÃ”Ã¸Î©factor xa activity level were V_E_R_B than in the nonpregnant state (p < .05).",1
the area under the plasma activityÃ”Ã¸Î©versusÃ”Ã¸Î©time curve was significantly V_E_R_B in P_G than in the P_G state (p < .05).,1
conclusion: the pharmacokinetics of enoxaparin sodium are significantly different during P_G than in the same women when nonpregnant.,1
the observed difference is likely because of V_E_R_B renal P_K of enoxaparin during P_G.,1
"although 5000 u of unfractionated heparin every 12 hours is usually effective prophylaxis for highrisk surgical patients, changes in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of unfractionated heparin during P_G make this regimen inadequate.1, 2 during the P_G of P_G, brancazio et al2 found both a V_E_R_B time to peak heparin effect and a V_E_R_B peak effect after subcutaneous administration of unfractionated heparin in P_G women compared with nonP_G women.",1
barbour et al1 demonstrated that heparin levels were below the therapeutic range for prophylaxis in 14 (100%) of 14 women receiving 5000 u of unfractionated heparin every 12 hours in the P_G.,1
"even when the dose was V_E_R_B to 7500 u every 12 hours in the P_G and 10,000 u every 12 hours in the P_G, heparin levels were subtherapeutic in 5 (56%) of 9 patients in the P_G and 6 (47%) of 13 patients in the P_G.",1
"the observed changes in the pharmacokinetics of unfractionated heparin are likely caused by physiologic alterations, such as V_E_R_B plasma volume, V_E_R_B glomerular filtration rate, and production of placental heparinase.",1

S_T_U_D_Y ii lists the P_K calculated in the study patients over the 3 study periods.,1
the P_K and the P_G were not significantly different in P_G or the P_G period.,1
"the plasma antiÃ”Ã¸Î©factor xa activity was generally V_E_R_B at the last measurable time point, and the maximum concentration achieved was significantly V_E_R_B in both early P_G and later P_G than during the P_G period.",1
the area under the plasma activityÃ”Ã¸Î©versusÃ”Ã¸Î©time curve was significantly V_E_R_B in P_G than during the P_G period (fig 1).,1
"the maximum concentration of enoxaparin and the time to reach the maximum concentration that were observed in our study S_T_U_D_Y in the P_G period were similar to measurements observed in other studies.5, 11 enoxaparin appears to be completely bioavailable after subcutaneous injection.11 therefore the apparent P_K and the P_K calculated after subcutaneous injection will correspond to the actual systemic P_K and volume of distribution of enoxaparin.",1
the systemic P_K of enoxaparin has been reported to be 0.83 to 1.86 l/h11 and 0.83 Ã”Ã¸Î© 0.19 l/h.12 the apparent P_K observed in our study group ranged from 0.6 to 0.8 l/h.,1
the volume of distribution of enoxaparin has been reported to be 5.2 to 9.3 l.11 in our S_T_U_D_Y the volume of distribution was V_E_R_B (3.1-4 l) than what has been reported.,1
the P_G of enoxaparin is reported to be 5.2 to 6.4 hours and is consistent with our findings.,1
"because P_G, which is a measure of the average time a drug resides in the body, is determined both by P_K and volume of distribution and because both P_K and volume of distribution changed in our study patients, we observed essentially no change in P_G.",1
"within the patient population studied, the 12-hour plasma concentration (maximum concentration) and the area under the plasma activityÃ”Ã¸Î©versusÃ”Ã¸Î©time curve were significantly V_E_R_B in early P_G than post partum.",1
"similarly, the apparent P_K and the P_K were V_E_R_B during early P_G than post partum.",1
"when early P_G is compared with late P_G, maximum concentration is further V_E_R_B in late pregnacy from early P_G, but P_K is also V_E_R_B in late P_G.",1
maximum concentration was the only parameter that was different between late P_G and P_G studies.,1
blombak et al13 studied the pharmacokinetics of dalteparin (2500 or 5000 units given once daily) in 17 P_G women at 32 to 35 weeksÃ”Ã¸Î© P_G.,1
"these investigators compared their findings with those from historical control S_T_U_D_Y and demonstrated that the P_K, P_K, and P_K were V_E_R_B in the cohort of P_G patients.",1
"we have shown that the pharmacokinetics of the lowmolecular-weight heparin enoxaparin sodium, like unfractionated heparin, V_E_R_B in P_G.",1
"because of normal physiologic changes in P_G, such as V_E_R_B plasma volume, V_E_R_B glomerular filtration rate, and production of placental heparinase, enoxaparin sodium appears to have a V_E_R_B P_K and V_E_R_B volume of distribution during early P_G compared with the P_G period in the same women.",1
"between early and late P_G, the maximum concentration achieved further decreases.",1
"however, P_K of enoxaparin apparently decreases in late P_G.",1
"nevertheless, because P_G is a hypercoagulable state and because retrospective studies have demonstrated an V_E_R_B risk of thrombosis of up to 12% in subsequent P_G,14 most clinicians use thromboprophylaxis in P_G.15 on the basis of prophylactic regimens that have been shown to be superior to placebo in preventing thrombosis in V_E_R_B-risk surgical patients, such as those undergoing total hip replacement,16 maintaining an antiÃ”Ã¸Î©factor xa activity of 0.1 to 0.2 iu/ml has been recommended.17 in summary, the pharmacokinetics of enoxaparin are different in P_G than in the same women post partum.",1
the pharmacokinetics also V_E_R_B throughout P_G and are different in early and late P_G.,1

"the rapid P_K of as found in this analysis is consistent with findings of pharmacokinetic analyses with iv as, with an as P_K estimate of 13.2 minutes obtained by newton et al [15] and estimates of less than ten minutes found by binh et al [16] and batty et al [17].",1
"given this rapid conversion of as to dha, the rate of dha formation may be limited by the rate of as P_K.",1
"the multiple samples S_T_U_D_Y in this study during the early period following as administration allowed for as P_K to be characterized using a mixed zero-order, lagged first-order P_K process that offered marked improvement in model fit over simpler P_K models.",1
"given that as is a weak acid with a pka of 4.6 [18], P_K though this mixedorder process may reflect as solubility and permeability changes occurring in the differing ph environments encountered in gastrointestinal transit.",1
gastric P_K of as may be limited by the solubility of the free acid form of as (168.2 ?g/ml) [19]; such solubility-limited P_K would plausibly correspond to a zeroorder process [20] such as the process characterizing the initial phase of as P_K in the mixed-order P_K model utilized in the present analysis.,1
"given the rapid conversion of as to dha upon as P_K, unpredictable as P_K would be expected to produce a pattern of dha appearance inconsistent with standard compartmental modelling.",1

the only significant covariate identified in the present analysis was the effect of P_G on the P_K of dha; this effect was estimated to produce a 42.3% (95% ci: 19.7% - 72.3%) proportional V_E_R_B in dha P_K in P_G women as compared to non-P_G controls.,1
"P_K did not appear to differ substantially between the two windows of P_G, but more S_T_U_D_Y in each trimester would likely be required for a difference between trimesters to be reliably detected.",1

"in the present analysis, the P_K of dha trended V_E_R_B for P_G S_T_U_D_Y, but the association between P_G status and V_E_R_B volume of distribution did not meet the statistical significance criteria (p < 0.001) for the described covariate analysis methods.",1

"as dha is metabolized through hepatic glucuronidation by ugt1a9 and ugt2b7 [12], induction of these enzymes could result in accelerated dha P_K.",1

"the parameter estimates they obtained, adjusted for the median weight of their S_T_U_D_Y (50 kg), were 88.5 l/hr [95% ci 60 - 117 l/h] for oral dha P_K and 231.5 l [95% ci 57 - 406 l] for dha volume of distribution.",1
their estimate for dha P_K in P_G patients is similar to the estimate in the present analysis (91 l/h).,1
the volume of distribution estimate from the present analysis (91.4 l) is V_E_R_B than found by these investigators.,1
"specifically, teja-isavadharm et al conducted non-compartmental analysis of dha P_K following oral as administration to patients with falciparum malaria; their estimate of 1.33 l/kg [range: 0.70 - 2.70 l/kg] [30] is similar to the estimate obtained in the current analysis, adjusted for the median weight of the P_G and control groups, of 1.58 l/kg.",1

"however, given the findings of mcgready et al, it seems probable that the significant P_G-associated V_E_R_B in dha oral P_K identified in the present analysis would be observed in P_G women with acute malaria.",1
"in these patients, V_E_R_B dha blood levels resulting from accelerated dha P_K could translate into V_E_R_B efficacy of as and related compounds.",1
a central finding of this analysis is that an V_E_R_B in dha oral P_K is associated with P_G.,1
"however, given that the P_G data were highly variable, the results presented here provide further support for the possibility that P_G patients would need to S_T_U_D_Y a V_E_R_B dose of as in order to achieve equivalent dha blood levels as obtained by non-P_G patients receiving the standard adult dose.",1
"although a V_E_R_B study would be required to definitively characterize the optimal as dose adjustments for P_G patients, the substantial P_G-associated V_E_R_B in dha P_K described in the present analysis underscores the need for such a study.",1

"this is due to the V_E_R_B extracellular ?uid, to the reduction of total protein P_K in plasma, to the V_E_R_B concentration of free fatty acids, to the V_E_R_B glomerular ?ltration rate, and to the state of enzymatic induction.14 thus, the investigation of the metopropol pharmacokinetics in P_G required highly sensitive analytical methods capable of quantitating the drug up to at least three times its P_K P_K (up to approximately 24 h after the administration of a single oral dose).",1

observations of a V_E_R_B oral P_K of antiepileptic drugs and of terbutaline during P_G have led to the recommendation of V_E_R_B maintenance doses in P_G women [dam et al. 1977].,1

"for the more commonly used aeds, the excess of positive slopes, i.e., increasing apparent clearances as P_G progressed, was consistent with the tendency of the plasma aed level to fall, and dosage to V_E_R_B, as P_G advanced.",1
"thus in P_G involving pht intake where there had been full seizure control before P_G, the mean minimum plasma pht level was 6.2 * 3.2 mg/l (n = 23) in those whose seizures remained fully controlled, and 6.5 mg/l in the two S_T_U_D_Y whose seizures recurred.",1

"therefore, parameters other than apparent P_K (e.g.,fall in plasma pht concentration relative to concentrationbefore P_G at the same dosage, or V_E_R_B dosage during P_G to maintain satisfactory plasma pht levels) probably provide a more valid measure of the V_E_R_B pht dosage requirement during P_G, although they do not quantitate it precisely.",1

median plasma pyr P_K were V_E_R_B in nonpregnant versus pregnant S_T_U_D_Y at most time points (fig. 4).,1

the variability in paracetamol P_K P_K was V_E_R_B during P_G (2.5 vs. 1.6 fold) suggesting a greater variability in P_K in P_G.,1
"in contrast, nimmo et al.10 documented no differences in paracetamol P_K P_K during labour when compared to non-P_G controls, except for those exposed to opioids during labour, following an oral dose of 1.5 g.",1
"when pharmacokinetics were compared, median P_K (15.5 vs. 20.3 l/h) and P_K (43.7 vs. 58.3 l) were signi?cantly V_E_R_B in the women undergoing caesarean delivery.",1
"after correction for body surface area, P_K was signi?cantly V_E_R_B in women undergoing caesarean delivery (9.6 vs. 10.9 l/h/m2 ).",1
"consequently, the difference between our data and the observations in healthy female volunteers is most likely due to the P_G-related changes, partly related to physiological changes of drug disposition during P_G,1Ã”Ã¸Î©3 and an oestrogen-mediated effect.13 abernethy et al.13 evaluated the impact of chronic oestrogen exposure on disposition of a single 650 mg dose of intravenous paracetamol.",1

kimura studied the pharmacokinetics of one neonate born to a mother taking zonisamide and reported the P_K to be 60.2 h [5].,1
"in the present S_T_U_D_Y, it is possible that the enzyme induction of udp-glucuronosyltransferase by carbamazepine in combination with zonisamide occurred even in the fetal and neonatal periods, and the P_K in one case was thus shortened to about the same as that of adults.",1
"in the present study, the P_K of zonisamide in the protein-unbound fraction and whey fraction were almost the same, and it was found that S_T_U_D_Y of zonisamide and protein in P_G plasma affects the concentration in P_G.",1

both the V_E_R_B in plasma P_K which occurred at the end of the first quarter of P_G and the rise of plasma P_K after delivery were highly significant.,1
"alternatively, a V_E_R_B in metabolic conversion ofprimidone to phenobarbitone during P_G can be taken into account.",1
"this would be in contrast with the suggestion of an V_E_R_B drug metabolism in P_G advanced to explain the lowering of plasma P_K of carbamazepine, clorazepate and phenytoin (dam et ai., 1979; eadie et ai., 1977; lander et ai., 1977; rey et ai., 1979).",1
"however, recent studies on changes of phenytoin disposition in P_G, including . evaluation of the urinary excretion of its major metabolite (p-hydroxyphenyl-5-phenylhydantoin), suggest that there is no significant change in phenytoin metabolism during P_G (kochenour et al 1980; landon and kirkley, 1979).",1
"dam et ai. (1979) suggest that a reasonable explanation for the V_E_R_B plasma P_K ofcarbamazepine seen in 3 patients during the third quarter of P_G may be an V_E_R_B rate of liver metabolism of the drug, in view of the fact that in these 3 patients there was a clear relationship with an V_E_R_B ratio between carbamazepine epoxide and the parent drug.",1
"prirnidone/phenobarbitone ratio during P_G hormones may V_E_R_B drug metabolism in different ways: progesterone is known to have an enzyme-inducing effect (krauer and krauer, 1977), but oestrogens are able to inhibit liver microsomal enzyme function (tephly and mannering, 1968).",1
"thus, a possible V_E_R_B in the rate of drug metabolism in P_G will also depend upon a balance between the effect of progesterone and oestrogen, which may V_E_R_B the metabolism of various drugs in different ways and at different times.",1
the peculiar behaviour of primidone during P_G should be taken into account in view of an undesired V_E_R_B in primidone-derived phenobarbitone P_K and/or an excessive rise of phenobarbitone P_K after delivery.,1
"in conclusion, our results suggest the usefulness of a careful monitoring of primidone and primidone-derived phenobarbitone during P_G and the P_G, in particular when newborns are breast-fed, in order to avoid possible sedation due to V_E_R_B P_K of primidone-derived phenobarbitone in P_G P_G. 259 acknowledgement the authors wish to express their gratitude to mrs l.",1
this prediction is consistent with the observation of similar increases in t2 and t3 oral P_K of indinavir (a cyp3a cleared drug) versus P_G.,1
"among these is approximately a 2-fold induction of cyp3a activity during the P_G (t3), as measured by 19-oh-midazolam formation P_K (hebert et al., 2008).",1
"many drugs routinely prescribed to P_G women are cleared by cyp3a enzymes, such as protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), antihypertensive drugs (e.g., nifedipine), and hypoglycemics (e.g., glyburide).",1

"interestingly, this is the first report which demonstrates a significant V_E_R_B in the antibioticÃ”Ã¸Î©s P_K P_K during P_G (S_T_U_D_Y 1).",1
"usually, the P_K values of ?-lactams seem to V_E_R_B moderately in P_G women while total P_K (clp, ml/min) of the same agents increases substantially [1, 2, 10, 11].",1
"since cft behaves as a weak acid and its uptake involves an P_K window in the upper gastrointestinal tract [12, 13], we would expect an V_E_R_B P_K rate due to P_G.",1
"indeed, the reduction in gastric emptying or intestinal transit rate and the V_E_R_B gastric ph V_E_R_B during P_G is expected to alter the P_K characteristics of drugs like cft [2].",1
"the V_E_R_B intravascular and extravascular volume and the V_E_R_B serum albumin concentration and thus V_E_R_B free fraction of the drug are expected to increase dramatically the P_G P_K, offering a solid explanation for the V_E_R_B P_K and P_K values observed in group b.",1
"in parallel, the V_E_R_B renal plasma flow, gfr and free fraction that occur during P_G will lead to an increase of the P_G total P_K (clp) of a drug like cft, i.e. primarily V_E_R_B though the kidneys.",1
"since changes of kel values reflect the net effect of changes in the P_K and the total P_K, according to the equation kel = clp / P_K. (1) we may assume that P_G caused a substantial V_E_R_B on cft P_K compared to a less dramatic V_E_R_B in clp [14].",1
"the extensive cft plasma S_T_U_D_Y (160%) offers a good support to this conclusion, since V_E_R_B S_T_U_D_Y during P_G will V_E_R_B drug penetration into tissues, increasing the P_K [15].",1
"the penicillinscloxacillinandflucloxacillin,presentinga90Ã”Ã¸Î© 95% plasma S_T_U_D_Y, are bound less in P_G than in non-P_G women [16].",1
"similar studies of the P_G effect on the pharmacokinetics of ?-lactam antibiotics reveal, irrespectively to their degree of S_T_U_D_Y, a substantial V_E_R_B in P_G clp compared to a relatively moderate V_E_R_B of P_K.",1

"plasma volume and total body water V_E_R_B by approximately 50% and 8 l, respectively, reaching a maximum by the 30th week of P_G, while serum albumin concentration decreases by approximately 25% by 12Ã”Ã¸Î©15 weeks of P_G and remains constant thereafter [2, 26].",1
"obviously, the net effect on the P_G P_K of a given antibiotic will depend on the exact P_G S_T_U_D_Y.",1
"for example, changes in P_K and P_K of ampicillin are more pronounced in the first and P_G of P_G while, in the P_G, ampicillin P_K has been found to V_E_R_B to non-P_G values [19].",1
"in addition, the V_E_R_B of tobramycin (a poorly lipid soluble weak base) P_K during the third compared to the P_G of P_G with a volume of distribution remaining stable, led to an V_E_R_B of the drugÃ”Ã¸Î©s P_K P_K [27].",1
"fetal serum cft P_K estimated during the end of the second and the beginning of the P_G of P_G, clearly indicate that cft is capable of crossing the placenta (fig. 2).",1
the P_K of cft in both P_G and fetal serum depended on the time following the administration of the drug.,1
"fetal serum cft levels initially remained below and thereafter exceeded the corresponding P_G ones, possibly due to a faster drug P_K from the P_G circulation.",1
"this could result in an apparent fall in the free non-ionized fetal concentration of cft compharmacokinetics of cefatrizine in P_G fetal diagn ther 2007;22:100Ã”Ã¸Î©106 105 pared to the corresponding P_G one, leading to concentration gradient and, therefore, to an Ã”Ã¸Î©ion trappingÃ”Ã¸Î© of the drug in the fetal compartment.",1
"a possible re-equilibration of the drug from the fetal to the P_G compartment could offer an explanation for the longer P_G P_K P_K, observed for cft during P_G.",1
"similarly to cft, after the intramuscular administration of ampicillin (pka = 2.5) fetal drug levels were initially found to be V_E_R_B and then exceeded the corresponding P_G ones, with drug levels decreasing at a sV_E_R_B rate in the fetal blood than the P_G one [29].",1
"conclusion in conclusion, the V_E_R_B of the oral P_K and P_K values of cft during P_G is in accordance with the evidence reported widely in the literature, that P_G dictates the administration of the maximum dosage of the antimicrobial, in relation to the underlying pathogenic cause.",1
"furthermore, since the P_K of oral cft is controlled by a saturable carrier mediated uptake mechanism [13] it could be suggested that an V_E_R_B in the frequency of administration rather than an V_E_R_B in the dose S_T_U_D_Y per dosing interval would result in an optimal coverage for both the fetus and the mother (i.e. 500 mg q6 h instead of 1,000 mg q12 h).",1
"the elevated P_G P_K P_K observed during P_G, the remarkable fetal P_K after the P_K of the drug from the P_G circulation and the time-dependent killing mechanism of the drug offer a good support to this suggestion.",1
"finally, the elevated P_G P_K values can be attributed to a mechanism of redistribution of the drug between the two compartments (mother and fetus Ã”Ã¸Î© P_G) and to a substantial V_E_R_B of the P_K (P_K) in relation to the predictable V_E_R_B of drug P_K.",1

"it is our opinion that breast feeding may start 3 days after prophylactic treatment with 1600 mg tinidazole i.v., the estimated exposure to tinidazole being considered minimal and probably neglectable.",1
it is particularly difficult to evaluate possible alterations of P_K due to P_G.,0
it is possible that the folate taken during P_G by three of the five S_T_U_D_Y may have contributed to the V_E_R_B phenytoin P_K.,1
"it is possible that the increasing fluid volume ofthe P_G woman's body, and that of the foetus, may in a sense dilute the drug dose, resulting in falling P_G plasma drug concentrations; this factor seems unlikely to account for the magnitude of the effect observed (eadie et al., 1977).",1
it is possible that this rapid dissolution and P_K occurred because we avoided touching the pills with lubricating gel during the examination.,1
it is possible to describe drug behavior in both individuals and in groups of patients.,0
it is readily transferred to the fetus but this investigation has shown that the P_G vein/P_G vein ratio and P_G V_E_R_B as the administration-delivery interval increases.,1
it is reassuring in the presented study that both the lpv exposures and trough P_K results support the use of standard dosing in this population.,1
it is suggested that the more rapid P_K of sotalol in P_G may be due to increases in renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate.,1
it is thus possible that a V_E_R_B oral P_K of phenytoin may account for the V_E_R_B dosage requirement of this drug during P_G.,1

it may be calculated that at this time the maximum daily dose to the infant would be 0.1 mg/kg body weight (assuming 3.5 kg body weight and 400 ml P_G consumed). 3 we conclude that until tinidazole has been proven harmless to the neonate breast feeding following i.v. administration of 1600 mg should not be initiated earlier than 72 h after the dose.,1
"it may be seen from fig. 5 that if the P_K ratios in the P_G and when at least three months P_G are equal to 1.0 for pgluc and 4ohp, then the amounts of pgluc and 4ohp reaching the systemic circulation would have V_E_R_B by factors of 1.41 and 1.61 respectively in the P_G compared to P_G.",1

"it was found that P_G levels effective against various pathogens implicated in P_G-fetal infections appeared at least three hours beyond administration of the drugs and ranged between 2.3 and 6.7 pglml, 1.56 and 15 pgiml, and 1.5 and 5 pg/ml for cefoxitin, moxalactam, and ,ceftazidime, respectively.",1

this assumption is valid because we assayed P_G and P_G P_K at delivery time simultaneously using the same,0
this can potentially be explained knowing that eight out of 10 analyzed twin P_G were pre-term and that there was a trend towards a V_E_R_B P_K to paracetamol glucuronide at the cost of V_E_R_B P_K of unchanged paracetamol in pre-term compared with term deliveries.,1

this corresponded to an average of 108% V_E_R_B in midazolam apparent oral P_K and 123% V_E_R_B in 1?-hydroxymidazolam formation P_K during P_G compared to P_G.,1
this corresponds to a V_E_R_B in steady-state plasma P_K of about 40%.,1
this could be done with a reasonable level of confidence in P_G tolerance of the V_E_R_B dose.,0
this could potentially impact both immunosuppressant efficacy and adverse response to tacrolimus.,0
this difference could be explained by an V_E_R_B ?rst pass effect through the liver.,0

this is probably related to the pharmacokinetic properties of oral administration.,0
"this is remarkable, given that sp is the antimalarial most commonly used during P_G in africa, but the results are consistent with the recent ?ndings from other pharmacokinetic studies conducted at the thai-burmese border with the artemisinins, lumefantrine, atovaquone, and proguanil; all studies show that P_G modi?es the drugsÃ”Ã¸Î© disposition, which results in much V_E_R_B P_K of the parent drug or metabolites in P_G women, compared with nonP_G adults [4, 5].",1
