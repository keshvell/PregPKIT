in view of the scientific evidence showing the benefits of the use of metformin during pregnancy with several studies demonstrating the safe use of this drug for mother and fetus there is the need to study the pharmacokinetics and placental transfer of metformin in nondiabetic pregnant women with pcos which was the objective of the investigation reported here,0

what this study adds  population pharmacokinetic modelling showed a substantially higher paracetamol clearance in women at delivery compared with a subset of the same women  weeks postpartum  the increase in total paracetamol clearance at delivery is due to a disproportional increase in glucuronidation clearance and a proportional increase in clearance of unchanged paracetamol and in oxidation clearance  compared with modelling based on metabolite fractions retrieved in urine only population modelling based on both plasma and urine collections was of added value to gain insight into how different metabolic pathways of paracetamol contribute to changes in total clearance,1

pregnant women are five to six times more likely than nonpregnant women to suffer from venous thromboembolism in the presence of acquired or congenital thrombophilia the risk is even higher for developing venous thromboembolism during pregnancy especially in women with a history of prior thromboembolic events there has been an ongoing shift from the earlier use of unfractionated heparin to the current use of lowmolecularweight heparin lmwh in pregnancy both for prophylaxis and for treatment of thrombotic diseases moreover the results from certain clinical studies have further extended the use of lmwh during pregnancy because they showed that enoxaparin may prevent pregnancy loss in women with acquired or constitutional thrombophilia however whether the dosing regimen defined on the basis of studies on a nonpregnant population can be adopted in pregnancy is a matter that requires investigation some studies have reported the failure of lwmh in preventing prosthetic heart valve thrombosis in pregnant women the pharmacokinetics of enoxaparin may be affected by physiological changes occurring during pregnancy such as a rapid increase in renal function which determines enoxaparin elimination rate and an increase in plasma volume which is closely linked to the enoxaparin volume of distribution,1

reasons for nonevaluable curves in the third trimester were one patient did not have measurable darunavir concentrations in the samples twice daily regimen probably due to nonadherence and was excluded from pharmacokinetic analysis third trimester and postpartum one patient on the oncedaily regimen took the darunavirritonavir medication at nighta  h curve was collected this patient was only partly included in the analysis one patient on the oncedaily regimen used  mg of darunavirritonavir once daily and was only included in the gmr calculations,1
therefore it is essential to optimize the dosing level and timing of preoperative administration of cefazolin to achieve effective antimicrobial protection from skin incision to skin closure,0
